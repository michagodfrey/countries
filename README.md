## Overview

This is the first advanced Frontend Mentor challenge I've completed. The data is provided by [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and I used the React library to render the data.

It was good practice of using React to display data from an external API and especicially so with the more subtle aspects, like the country border links.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
